# Rainfall-Analyser

The Rainfall Analyser is a uni project of mine. This program is used to read and analyse rainfall data 
from bom.gov.au and then create a graphical representation of it.

The Beta (final version) consists of two packages, the analyser and visualiser
You can download a csv of rainfall data from bom.gov.au. The analyser has a Main() where you can then read this file and it will analyse it, 
convert it to what is needed for the UI and store the new copy.
The analyser is console base and consist of the classes below:

The visualiser then reads the analysed files, builds the UI, and you are able to toggle between the rainfall data for these locations as seen in the demo below:
